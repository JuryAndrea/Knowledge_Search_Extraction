### Autohor: Jury Andrea D'Onofrio

### To run instrumentor.py
Please make sure to import the libraries `os`, `nltk`, and `ast`. Then you will be able to run the file correctly.

The script will populate the folder named `parsed`.

### To run testgen_random.py
Please make sure to import the libraries:
- `os`,
- `numpy` as `np`, 
- `sys`,
- `instrumentor` as `inst`,
- `random`,
- `shutil`,
- `json`,
- `seaborn` as `sns`
- `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`
- `pandas` as `pd`.

Moreover, you need to add:

from `deap` import `creator`, `base`, `tools`, `algorithms`,
from `scipy.stats` import `wilcoxon`.
